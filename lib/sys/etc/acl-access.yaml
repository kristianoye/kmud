#  This file seeds permissions and re-asserts permissions each time
#  the MUD starts.
#
#  The first portion of this file configures permissions sets which
#  are aliases to simplify defininig permissions on the file and 
#  directory entries that follow.
#

#    r - Read a file / R - Read a directory
#    w - Write or append to a file
#    d - Delete a file / D - Delete files and directories
#    c - Create/append a file / C - Create files and directories
#    p - Read permissions / P - Write/change permissions
#    m - Read metadata / M - Write metadata
#    L - Load/clone/destruct
#    x - Execute (if applicable)
#    O - Change ownership
#    S - View system files
